# ScSvg

This software allows you to visually simulate state charts that are in SVG format. The routines only work with SVG exported from UMLET(https://www.umlet.com/). If you export SVG of a diagram form Visio for example, the humble parser that I have in this piece of software won't work.

This work comes out of frustration at the lack of a good visual simulator for a non-trivial state chart.
