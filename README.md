# ScSvg

This software allows you to visually simulate state charts that are in SVG format. The routines only work with SVG exported from UMLET(https://www.umlet.com/). If you export SVG of a diagram form Visio for example, the humble parser that I have in this piece of software won't work.

This work comes out of frustration at the lack of a good visual simulator for a non-trivial state chart.


Steps on how to try it:
- Clone the repo
- Change directory to the clone
- Create a python virtual environment (py -3 -m venv pyenv)
- Start the virtual environment (pyenv/scripts/activate.bat)
- Install the required packages (pip install -r requirements.txt)

The above commands would be different on macOS and linux.
